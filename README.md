Face-Recognition
================

This simple app uses OpenCV and the web.py frameworks for facial recognition.
The user uploads image files and enters a name in to train the model for facial recognition.
For actual recognition the user uploads another file(or same but then what's the point) and the
app will give the result. It's important to upload multiple files for each individual as that will train the model
with the different facial expressions. 

Required: OpenCV, Numpy, Web.py
