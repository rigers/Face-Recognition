		<p>
			This simple web app utilizes OpenCV framework to analyze and recognize faces. 
            In order for a face to be recognized the model needs to be trained. 
            To train the model submit an image of a face and type a name. 
            The more different images submited (i.e different facial expressions) the more accurate the model is at recognizing a face. 
            To recognize a face upload a different image from the ones used to train the model and the app will give the results.</p>
